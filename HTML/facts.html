                        When Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered construction of the Great Wall around 221 B.C., 
                    the labor force that built the wall was made up largely of soldiers and convicts. 
                    It is said that as many as 400,000 people died during the wall's construction, 
                    many of these workers were buried within the wall itself.
