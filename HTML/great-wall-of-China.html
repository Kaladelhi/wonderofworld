                <h1>The Great Wall of China</h1>
                <p>The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, totaling more than 13,000 miles 
                    in length, located in northern China. Perhaps the most recognizable symbol of China and its long and vivid 
                    the Great Wall was originally conceived 
                    by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century B.C. as a means of preventing incursions from barbarian 
                    nomads. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best-known and best-preserved section of the Great Wall was built in the 14th through 17th 
                    centuries A.D., during the Ming dynasty. Though the Great Wall never effectively prevented invaders 
                    from entering China, 
                    it came to function as a powerful symbol of Chinese civilization’s enduring strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between the 18th and 20th centuries, the Great Wall emerged as the most common emblem of 
                    China for the Western world, and a symbol both physical – as a manifestation of Chinese strength – and 
                    a psychological representation of the barrier maintained by the 
                    Chinese state to repel foreign influences and exert control over its citizens.
