                <h1>Colosseum</h1>
                <p>Measuring some 620 by 513 feet (190 by 155 meters), the Colosseum was 
                    the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. Unlike many earlier amphitheaters, 
                    which had been dug into hillsides to provide adequate support, the Colosseum was 
                    a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete. The distinctive exterior had 
                    three stories of arched entrances–a total of around 80–supported by semi-circular columns. 
                    Each story contained columns of a different order (or style): 
                    At the bottom were columns of the relatively simple Doric order, 
                    followed by Ionic and topped by the ornate Corinthian order. 
                    Located just near the main entrance to the Colosseum was the Arch of Constantine, built in A.D. 
                    315 in honor of Constantine I’s victory over Maxentius at Pons Milvius.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colosseum was commissioned around A.D. 70-72 by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a 
                    gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, Vespasian’s son Titus opened the Colosseum–officially known 
                    as the Flavian 
                    Amphitheater–with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the 20th century, a combination of weather, natural disasters, neglect and vandalism had 
                    destroyed nearly two-thirds of the original Colosseum, including all of the arena’s marble 
                    seats and its decorative elements. Restoration efforts began in the 1990s, and have proceeded 
                    over the years, 
                    as the Colosseum continues to be a leading attraction for tourists from all over the world.
