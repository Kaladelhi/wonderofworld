                <p>
                    The Pyramid of Kukulcan or Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo, a name given by the Spanish Conquistadors) 
                    tre of Chich’en Itza, it was built over a preexisting temple between 800 and 900 CE. 
                    It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base 53.3 meters wide on all four sides. 
                    It towers above the other monuments at 24 meters tall with a 6-meter temple on top of the 
                    highest platform. Before access to the throne room of the pyramid was restricted, you 
                    could climb to the top and, on a clear day, 
                    see the top of the grand pyramid at the nearby ruin site of Ek Balam.

                    The Mesoamerican fascination with, and knowledge of, math and astronomy shines when 
                    examining the details of its architecture. Each of the four sides has 91 steps ascending 
                    it, 364 steps total, with the temple topping the pyramid considered an addition step 
                    totalling 365, each step representing a day in the calendar. Additionally, the pyramid’s 
                    nine stages, bisected by a staircase on each side, represent the eighteen months of the 
                    Maya Calendar year. The pyramid was built to be a physical representation of the Maya 
                    Calendar (the same calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012), while its 
                    orientation, slightly North East, is believed to have been calculated in order to create 
                    the phenomenon know as the “Descent of Kukulcan”.
